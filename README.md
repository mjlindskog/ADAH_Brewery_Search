A Drink Around Here is a brewery search application. When the user inputs their location, it will display information on breweries nearby. Clicking onto a listed brewery opens a window with location information, and it also searches the area for entertainment events the user might be interested in and will also display the current weather.

### Technologies Used:

- APIs: OpenBreweryDB, Ticketmaster, OpenWeather
- Libraries: Zurb Foundation, jQuery, Leaflet CSS and JS

### Future Development:
